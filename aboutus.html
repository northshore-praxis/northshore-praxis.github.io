					  <h1>About Us</h1>
					  <p>NorthShore Praxis was established in Toronto, Canada in 2018 amidst growing speculation in the healthcare industry that neuroprosthetics are to become the gold standard in prosthetic solutions worldwide. The project was established particularly for the Canadian market which sees itself far behind neuroprosthetic advancements available currently in countries in the European Union and Asia. With the government-funded healthcare programs native to Canada, NorthShore Praxis aims to partner with organizations to expand their neuroprosthetic range of care.</p>

							  <h3>Current Leadership</h3>
							  <p>The founder of the organization is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfinatan">Rares Finatan </a>, a graduate of The University of Western Ontario. His initial interest in neuroprosthetics began in 2011 following a brief encounter with <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/BUCBHT"> <em>Beyond Humanity?: The Ethics Of Biomedical Enhancement (Allen Buchanan, Julian Savulescu)</em></a>. This led to further research in adaptive neural network controls found in bionic arms, as well as several self-directed investment portfolios primarily focused on the neuroprosthetic industry. Rares is now a post-graduate student at the University of Toronto looking to expand his ability to grow NorthShore Praxis with predictive analytics and machine learning.</p>
